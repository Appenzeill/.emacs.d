#+STARTUP: showall
* Daan's Personal Emacs Config 
[[./showcase.png]]
** Setup
My own personal emacs configuration, it has 2 parts.
myinit.org and config.org.
The myinit.org has all the logic of my personal setup, the config.org is for mainly for personal information not relevant to the setup. Like RSS feeds.

** .emacs file contents
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Point to root of emacs.d and additional directories.
  (setq path "~/.emacs.d")
  (setq additional-path "~/.emacs-additional.d")

  ;; Enable and dissable modules by setting them t or nil.
  (setq programming t)
  (setq literate t)
  (setq org-roam t)
  (setq applications t)
  (setq embedded t)

  ;; Enable or dissable additional config and software. (Langtool, PlantUML and config)
  (setq additional t)

  ;; Packaging configuration

  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

** Upcomming revamp
My config has become a bit stale and lacks propper support for my daily workflow.
So I will revamp it when I have some free time left.
*** Emacs Server
- [ ] Make emacs run as a server on systems where that is setup.
*** Languages
- [ ] Python support
- [ ] More dynamic LSP support (ssh support, multiple languages etc)
*** Visual
- [ ] Make dashboard more modern/personal
- [ ] Change default font to Iosvka when available on the system
- [ ] Ligatures
- [ ] Emoji support
- [ ] Change theme
- [ ] Make light and darkmode theme switcher function
*** Org-Roam
- [ ] Organize my notes better
- [ ] Use it more in my life
*** Try packages
- [ ] Popper
- [ ] Vertico
- [ ] Modus themes
*** Remove bloat/unused packages
Make emacs more lean by removing unused packages and files. mail.org for example.
*** Additional
- [ ] Try Nyxt and integrate it with emacs
- [ ] Try vterm

** Inspiration & credits
This is my personal emacs config which started out with parts of code based on the config from matman26.
