* Daan's Personal Emacs Config 
[[./showcase.png]]
** Setup
My own personal emacs configuration, it has 2 parts.
myinit.org and config.org.
The myinit.org has all the logic of my personal setup, the config.org is for mainly for personal information not relevant to the setup. Like RSS feeds.

** .emacs file contents
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Point to root of emacs.d directory.
  (setq path "~./emacs.d")

  ;; Enable and dissable modules by setting them t or nil.
  (setq programming nil)
  (setq literate nil)
  (setq applications nil)
  (setq exwm nil)

  ;; Packaging configuration
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
  (add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))

  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-refresh-contents)
    (package-install 'use-package))

  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package))

  ;; Load base config.
  (org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/general.org")

  ;; Load modules that are t.
  (when programming
    (org-babel-load-file (concat path "/modules/programming.org")))

  (when literate
    (org-babel-load-file (concat path "/modules/literate.org")))

  (when applications
    (org-babel-load-file (concat path "/modules/applications.org")))

  (when exwm
    (org-babel-load-file (concat path "/modules/exwm.org")))

** Inspiration & credits
This is my personal emacs config which started out with parts of code based on the config from matman26.
