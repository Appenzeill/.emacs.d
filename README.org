* Daan's Personal Emacs Config 
[[./showcase.png]]
** Setup
My own personal emacs configuration, it has 2 parts.
myinit.org and config.org.
The myinit.org has all the logic of my personal setup, the config.org is for mainly for personal information not relevant to the setup. Like RSS feeds.

** .emacs file contents

** Inspiration & credits
This is my personal emacs config which started out with parts of code based on the config from matman26.
