* Daan's Personal Emacs Config 
[[./showcase.png]]
** Setup
My own personal emacs configuration, it has 2 parts.
myinit.org and additional-config.org.
The myinit.org has all the logic of my personal setup, the additional-config.org is for mainly for personal information not relevant to the setup. Like RSS feeds.

** .emacs file contents
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)

(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))
  
;; Standaard packages.
(setq evil-want-keybinding nil)
(use-package evil
	:ensure t)
(evil-mode 1)
	
(use-package org
	:ensure t)

;; Configuratie file.
(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/myinit.org")
(org-babel-load-file "~/emacs-additional-config/config.org")
#+END_SRC

** Inspiration & credits
This is my personal emacs config which started out with parts of code based on the config from matman26.
