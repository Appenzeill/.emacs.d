* Daan's Personal Emacs Config 
[[./showcase.png]]
** Setup
My own personal emacs configuration, it has 2 parts.
general.org and config.org.
The general.org has all the logic of my personal setup, the config.org is for mainly for personal information not relevant to the setup. Like RSS feeds.

** .emacs file contents
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

  ;; Enable and dissable modules by setting them t or nil.
  (setq programming t)
  (setq literate t)
  (setq org-roam t)
  (setq applications t)

  ;; Enable or dissable additional config and software. (Langtool, PlantUML and config)
